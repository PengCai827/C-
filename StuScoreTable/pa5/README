ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]


In the remove method of Table.cpp, I use these code found from the book of the library, the technic thus are similar:
   
    while (del != NULL) {
        if (del->key == key) {
            pre->next= del->next;//If the key is found, making the one before the key link to the one after the key;
            if (del == tail) {//If the key at the end of the list, making the one ahead of the key become the end of the list;
                tail = pre;
                numBucket--;
            }
            delete del;
            break;
        }
        pre = del;//To iterate the whole list;
        del = del->next;
    }

KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:


Limitation: The Table cannot tell whether a name parameter is actually a name, it can be numbers in string format.
